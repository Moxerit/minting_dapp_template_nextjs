# Minting Dapp Template

This project will be updated for ERC721A and ERC721A-B once it is released. 
The aim is to reduce redunant contracts and create a source for gas effecient contracts used in big projects that can be easily modified.


## To-Do:
- Update networks to an easily changeable variable for faster deployment from testnet => mainet.
- Include more comments and documentation for setup / deploy from start to finish.
- Add more parameters for the minting process like: increment/decrement, batch sizes, IPFS, Merkle Tree white lists, costs, and general quality of life additions.
